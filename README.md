Bliss.slider.js
============

Got tied of searching for the right slider only to discover numerous plugins that are buggy and/or overly complex. 
I therefore decided to code my own. 

Built upon jQuery version 1.8.1

Procedural based (functions only), likely to be object based/plugin soon.

Features
--------

- Autoplay
- Previous/Next links
- Slider markers (What are these called?)
